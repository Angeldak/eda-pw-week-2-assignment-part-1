// REQUIRED FEATURES:
// 1 - Create a variable called `firstName` and assign it the value of your first name
let firstName = "Lloyd";
console.log("my first name is: " + firstName);
// 2 - Create a second variable called `lastName` and assign it the value of your last name
let lastName = "Prock";
console.log("my last name is: " + lastName);
// 3 - Create a third variable called `fullName`, assign it the value of your first and last name
// (remember, you already have variables for this, can you use those?)
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
// 4 - Console log the value of `fullName`
console.log(fullName);
// 5 - Create a variable called `luckyNumber` and assign it the value of your lucky number.
let luckyNumber = 8;
console.log("my lucky number is", luckyNumber);
// 6 - Console log this sentence, adding in the variables you created above:
// 'My name is (full name), and I think (lucky number) is a winner!'.
// Refer back to the videos if you need help with this one.
console.log("My name is " + fullName + ", and I think", luckyNumber, "is a winner!");
// 7 - Create a variable named `adventurous` and set it to a boolean value (true or false)
let adventurous = true;
console.log("me being adventurous is:", adventurous);
// 8 - Create a variable named `food`, and set its value to a string of your favorite food
let food = "Sushi";
console.log("favorite food: " + food);
// 9 - Create a variable called `pets` and set it to the value of the number of pets you have
let pets = 2;
console.log("current pets:", pets);
// 10 - Create a variable called `friendsPets` and assign it the value of the number of pets your friend has
let friendsPets = 3;
console.log("friend has:", friendsPets, "pets");
// 11 - Add two pets to your `pets` variable
pets += 2;
console.log("added two pets:", pets);
// 12 - Create a constant variable called `allowedPets` and set it to a number value of your choice
const allowedPets = 4;
console.log("allowed pets are:", allowedPets);
// 13 - Create a conditional: if adventurous is true, console log "Adventures are great!",
// if it's not true, console log "How about we stay home?"
if (adventurous) {
    console.log("Adventures are great!");
} else {
    console.log("How about we stay home?");
}
// 14 - Create a compound conditional: if luckyNumber is 2 and adventurous is true,
// console log "Roll the dice!"
if (luckyNumber === 2 && adventurous) {
    console.log("Roll the dice!");
}
// 15 - Write a conditional that console logs "I can have more pets!"
//if the value of `pets` is less than the value of `allowedPets`,
// console logs "I have enough pets" if the value of `pets` is equal to the value of `allowedPets`,
// and console logs "Oh no, I have too many pets!"
// if the value of `pets` is greater than the value of `allowedPets`.
if (pets < allowedPets) {
    console.log("I can have more pets!");
} else if (pets === allowedPets) {
    console.log("I have enough pets");
} else if (pets > allowedPets) {  //this could also just be an else, correct? since Less than and equals are taken care of already
    console.log("Oh no, I have too many pets!");
}
// STRETCH GOALS:

// 16 - Make a variable called `mostPets` and a conditional that
// correctly checks the `pets` and `friendsPets` variables, and
// assigns the highest value to `mostPets`. There's several possibilities --
// be sure to think through all the scenarios. 
// console.log `mostPets` after the conditional has run.
let mostPets = 0;
let winner = "";

if (pets > friendsPets) {
    mostPets = pets;
    winner = "me";
} else if (friendsPets > pets) {
    mostPets = friendsPets;
    winner = "my friend";
} else if (pets === friendsPets) {
    mostPets = pets;
    winner = "both of us, we tied!";
}

console.log(mostPets);
console.log("the person with the most pets has", mostPets, "pets");
console.log("the person who had the most pets is " + winner);

//version 2 - stretch
array = [pets, friendsPets]
maxPets = Math.max(...array);
console.log("max pets via array/spread", maxPets);

// 17 - Write a *switch* statement that logs:
//      "First is the worst" if your lucky number is 1
//      "Second is the best" if your lucky number is 2
//      "Third is the one with the polka dot dress" if your lucky number is 3
//      Otherwise, log "Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity"
//      You'll need to research how to use switch statements!

    case 1:
        console.log("First is the worst");

        console.log("Third is the one with the polka dot dress");
        break;
    default: console.log("Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity");
}
// 18 -- Rewrite question 13 with a `ternary` operator. You'll need to do research!
